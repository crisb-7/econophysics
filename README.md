# Econophysics 

This repository explores and reconstructs Victor Yakovenko's and Ian Wright's statistical mechanics models as applied to the realm of money. The project is divided into three main parts, each focusing on a distinct aspect of economic modeling.

## To-do list

### Models

- [x] Yakovenko Python Model
- [ ] Verify Yakovenko model correctness
- [ ] Implement tax on Yakovenko Model
- [ ] Wright Python Model
- [ ] Implement well-being analysis

### Dev

- [ ] Modularize to use delta/uniform initial distribution
- [ ] Proper package usage
- [ ] Interface for proper Git development (main/branch + PRs)
- [ ] Write unit tests
- [ ] Add README description of constants
- [ ] Benchmark & optimize performance (speed + memory)
- [ ] Develop a visualization module 

### Design

- [ ] Rethink design (tax & well-being)

## Yakovenko's Statistical Mechanics Model

In this section, we delve into the investigation and reconstruction of Yakovenko's statistical mechanics model [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0001432)] applied to the dynamics of money. 

## Wright's Model

Moving beyond simple pairwise interactions, Part 2 delves into Wright's model, which introduces a more complex framework introduced by Ian Wright's paper: _The social architecture of capitalism_ [[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0401053)]. This model doesn't merely consider interactions between two agents but incorporates categories of agents and a market through which money exchanges take place. By simulating these multi-agent interactions, we aim to capture a more realistic representation of economic systems.

## Well-being in these models

This segment introduces two "mock" models to represent the well-being of a society based on its monetary wealth. The relationship between the distributions of money that arise from the two models and its effect on the overall welfare of the community is explored.
